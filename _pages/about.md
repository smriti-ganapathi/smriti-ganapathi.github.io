Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student in Public Policy at the University of Chicago. I study sexual and gender-based violence, primarily focusing on the causal impact of criminal justice responses as well as media and messaging.  My work aims to understand the causes and consequences of GBV, the norms that enable it, and scalable policies that can prevent it. 

In addition to my own research, I have extensive work experience in academia as well as international organisations. I have worked on various experimental and quasi-experimental studies on how cultural norms contribute to gender equity and violent crime. I have also been involved in field experiments on womenâ€™s health, overseeing data collection and intervention implementation.

If you'd like to chat or collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me at sganapathi@uchicago.edu!
