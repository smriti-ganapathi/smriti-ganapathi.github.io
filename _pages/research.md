* <strong> Policing Intimate Partner Violence: Curbing Abuse or Shifting it? </strong> \
Policing is frequently posited to be an effective tool to deter perpetrators of intimate partner violence from repeating their abuse. However, abuse in intimate relationships often involves psychological violence and coercive control, which can be difficult to detect as compared to physical violence, but potentially just as harmful. Do criminal sanctions actually deter abusers? Or do perpetrators merely shift from using physical violence to more subtle forms of abuse like coercive control? I study this using granular incident-level police data from the United Kingdom. Results indicate that, on aggregate, charges reduce both physical violence and coercive control, driven largely by pairs of partners who do not file further complaints with the police. However, there is a shift from violence to coercive control among pairs that do return. The severity of the violence experienced, along with police officer characteristics, appear to be instrumental in this shift.
